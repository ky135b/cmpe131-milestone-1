[paragraph 1 @n-k-leung]
When it comes to considering the impact of engineering solutions to problems, we should also consider the scope of the problem. For example, our project has a small scope, and it is unlikely our project will do real good or harm, besides the value of learning for us team members, and so it will likely have a small impact. On the other end of the spectrum, take professional software engineers at a company like NASA. An engineer there might work on safely launching a human into outer space, a much wider scope. If they succeed, it is a huge achievement and helps to further scientific advancement. If they fail, the result could be a loss of human life. The scope is greater, so the impact, whether positive or negative, is greater as well. Often the impact is not as bad as literal loss of life, but when the problems have similarly large scope, these failures can be disastrous: take for instance the failure of FTX, which wiped out billions. On the other hand, there are successes such as the internet itself, which has been revolutionary for society. Engineering solutions have a wide range of impacts on the economy, the environment, and society itself, these impacts increasing in magnitude as the scope of the problem does.
